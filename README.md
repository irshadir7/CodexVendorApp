#This repository contains a sample app that implements MVI architecture using Kotlin, ViewModel, LiveData, Hilt and etc.

# NYC Artiles
 Smart Dubai Assignment
 
# Tools and Technologies 
1- Dagger Hilt
2- Live Data
3- Retrofit 
4- Kotlin Coroutines
5- Glide For Image Loading
6- MVI(Model View Intent)
7- Navigation Component

#The app has following packages:

di: Dependency Injection used for hilt injection with different modules,

intent: this has the intent for different network calls,
 
model: data models to parse API data responce,

network: interface to call different end pointss,

repository: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.,

ui: View classes along.,

vm:View Model Classes, 

utils: Utility classes.

#Build Types 
The Project has three build types 
1-Debug
2-staging
3-realease
to test and realease different versions

#### How To Run
